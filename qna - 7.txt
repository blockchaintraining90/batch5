girish.khemani76@gmail.com .  to  Everyone 10:14 PM

parveen.sahrawat1209@gmail.com .  to  Everyone 10:16 PM
Sir please explain mix hash again
yashdoshi51 .  to  Everyone 10:17 PM
sir if its genesis block  where is the data coming?
prakashvedv .  to  Everyone 10:17 PM
can you explain forking again pls
shreyasbt .  to  Everyone 10:17 PM
What's the difference between the coinbase address and the address we put in setEtherbase?
prakashvedv .  to  Everyone 10:19 PM
got it .. thanks

how will the address in the coinbase come into play when there are multiple participants in the network
You  to  Everyone 10:23 PM

ramanbhardwaj364@gmail.com .  to  Everyone 10:23 PM

girish.khemani76@gmail.com .  to  Everyone 10:24 PM
sir, what was --networkid 1999 in the geth command we issued
shreyasbt .  to  Everyone 10:24 PM
Can you please clarify what exactly will be "private" when we say we're creating/forking a private eth blockchain node?
yashdoshi51 .  to  Everyone 10:24 PM
sir if its genesis block  where is the data coming?

jinsongeo .  to  Everyone 10:24 PM
is the coinbase mentioned in the genesis.json only for the genesis block or for the entire network?
jinsongeo .  to  Everyone 10:26 PM
so if a new participant comes, will a new one be added?
Ishant Wadhwa .  to  Everyone 10:26 PM
when we create a coin, it will create a new chain or part of eth only?
jinsongeo .  to  Everyone 10:27 PM
what about the main net
yashdoshi51 .  to  You (Direct Message) 10:27 PM
sir if its genesis block  where is the data coming?

Ishant Wadhwa .  to  Everyone 10:28 PM
sorry token not coins
zuluoscar65 .  to  Everyone 10:29 PM
sir we can only coins? can token also be forked? as they asre smart contract. pls explain
we can only fork*
shreyasbt .  to  Everyone 10:30 PM
Shouldn't the account be the same in both setEtherbase and the account mentioned in the genesis file, since you mentioned they both are for receiving mining rewards?
shreyasbt .  to  Everyone 10:33 PM
Understood, thank you
Can you please clarify what exactly will be "private" when we say we're creating/forking a private eth blockchain node?
girish.khemani76@gmail.com .  to  Everyone 10:33 PM
sir the role of the second network id is not clear
zuluoscar65 .  to  Everyone 10:33 PM
ok sir
girish.khemani76@gmail.com .  to  Everyone 10:33 PM
yes

cloning at a particular time 
Pranav B  to  Everyone 10:36 PM
here forking is done because we are connecting testnet.. we will need genesis block of mainnet only to create node? 
in mainnet ethereum
saeed_raghib@msn.com .  to  Everyone 10:42 PM
how many blocks are necessary to copy?
yashdoshi51 .  to  Everyone 10:42 PM
sir if we are able to change the data how is it safe and reliable?
Ishant Wadhwa .  to  Everyone 10:42 PM
when we create an eth token, that token has diff chain or part of ETH chain only?
saeed_raghib@msn.com .  to  Everyone 10:42 PM
i mean for forking 
jinsongeo .  to  Everyone 10:43 PM
if we are forking, then we wont need to setup the genesis block?
yashdoshi51 .  to  Everyone 10:43 PM
sir if we are able to change the data how is it safe and reliable?
like we are able to copy the data
why would we need to copy it?
saeed_raghib@msn.com .  to  Everyone 10:44 PM
so if we mention the blocks then does that mean that we know what is in those blocks?
Pranav B  to  Everyone 10:44 PM
protocols can be changed in forking?
You  to  Everyone 10:46 PM
jinsongeo .  to  Everyone 10:46 PM
so our genesis bloc + borrowed bocks
yashdoshi51 .  to  Everyone 10:46 PM
so the data in the genesis block will have data of parent block?
Pranav B  to  Everyone 10:47 PM
protocols are specified only in genesis block???
Pranav B  to  Everyone 10:47 PM
ok thanks
jinsongeo .  to  Everyone 10:51 PM
will the new block in our network have previous block link to the genesis block or the borrowed blocks
