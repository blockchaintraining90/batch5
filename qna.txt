how much wei is that equal to?
Yash Purohit  to  Everyone 10:32 PM
this gas fees is irrespective of amount of ethers transffered ?
as the gas price is same for 10 eth and 105 eth.
Aravind M  to  Everyone 10:33 PM
So even if we sending 0 ETH the gas fee will be: 0.00042 ETH
You  to  Everyone 10:37 PM
1 Ether = 1000000000000000000 Wei.
1 Ether = 1000000000000000 Kwei.
1 Ether = 1000000000000 Mwei.
1 Ether = 1000000000 Gwei.
1 Ether = 1000000 Szabo.
1 Ether = 1000 Finney.
1 Ether = 0.001 Kether.
1 Ether = 0.000001 Mether.

Should I interpret that 0 ETH transaction like below: 
as you told the 0.00042 ETH is the underlying value of a network is proven right? even if we send 0 eth there will be charges for the network other than miners
