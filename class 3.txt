is data replication is also happen?
minimum number of replication?
ok
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 07:40 PM
why is anonymity so important 
From avrgayathri@gmail.com . to Everyone 07:40 PM
privacy perhaps?
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 07:47 PM
what happens if Hash S is missing?
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 07:49 PM
can u plz explain this topic clearly right now sir 
From prakashvedv . to Everyone 07:49 PM
How would merkel tree look like if there are odd numbers of transactions?
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 07:51 PM
if two or more nodes solve the consensus challenge at same time and validated by other nodes then which node to be included first in the block chain
From avrgayathri@gmail.com . to Everyone 07:58 PM
is it possible that the sha is not generatable any more with the required signature? that is leading 10 zeros in the beginning
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:01 PM
are cryptography and hash are same or they are different.
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:01 PM
can u explain with another example i can't able to understood properly 
From zuluoscar65 . to Everyone 08:02 PM
every miner is a node ? or miner and nodes are different?
From Me to Everyone 08:02 PM
https://andersbrownworth.com/Blockchain/block.html
From avrgayathri@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:02 PM
if calculating a nonce value is time consumig, how much time it takes for a transaction to get added to a block?
From shreyasbt . to Everyone 08:04 PM
Until the block is formed (which takes ~1hr), will we still be able to see all txns publicly on the txn pool at least?
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:04 PM
can u explain the puzzle block again  sir 
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:05 PM
if nonce is found then successful node is free to add to its local ledger? when other nodes receive that broadcast and if they also validate it .. is it must for them to add that block to their local chain .. or can they ignore
From prakashvedv . to Everyone 08:05 PM
is mining pool counted as a single node?
From mohankumardmk1997 . to Everyone 08:06 PM
why are there different miners?.... what makes them different?
From shreyasbt . to Everyone 08:07 PM
How does the txn validity is established? In the sense, at what point does the txn show up on the explorer?
From i@hitenbhatia.com . to Everyone 08:08 PM
Do the miners choose the transaction or is it randomly assigned?
Ok
Get it
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 08:09 PM
what does it mean high transaction fee? is the "gas" that is spent in buying crypto?
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:10 PM
so if every one must add the winning block ; then why do the chains become different
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 08:10 PM
ok, so in private chain where is the gas? what is the reward?
From avrgayathri@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:10 PM
private networks dont need to reward, they host the infra 
From Me to Everyone 08:11 PM
https://andersbrownworth.com/Blockchain/block.html
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:14 PM
hello sir 
From Me to Everyone 08:15 PM
pls give me 2mins
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:15 PM
ok sir 
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 08:15 PM
will the range of zeros increase or decrease if the math problem is being solved quickly by miners?
From Hiten Bhatia to Everyone 08:15 PM
Not audible
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:15 PM
so if every one must add the winning block ; then why do the chains become different

From dheerajmaske . to Everyone 08:16 PM
nonce is directly proportional to the preceding no of zeros
From jinsongeo . to Everyone 08:17 PM
will all the miners be trying to create the next block with the same set of transactions
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 08:18 PM
cant hear
From 1081btc . to Everyone 08:18 PM
In this case who gets the gas?
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:19 PM
ok
From parveen.sahrawat1209@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:19 PM
yes
From avrgayathri@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:19 PM
no it broke for a while but back
From maananparmar@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:19 PM
It is cracking sir
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:19 PM
yes 
From mrneeraj03 . to Everyone 08:19 PM
yes
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:19 PM
what happens if some transactions are not getting picked in the block formation process
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:19 PM
yes sir
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 08:19 PM
was fading in and out
From avrgayathri@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:19 PM
it was crackingmomentarily
better now
From dheerajmaske . to Everyone 08:19 PM
Instead of storing the whole data what if we store the meta data(Encoded hash value )on the blockchain.Less data->small nonce->less difficulty->Faster verification->Less power consumption. Can we do this?
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 08:20 PM
where is miner 2 in this example?
From 1081btc . to Everyone 08:20 PM
are all transactions in a block created by one miner?
From avrgayathri@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:20 PM
can there be a trasnaction overlap in two blocks?
how does it take care of not includin the same transaction in different blocks (b6/b7)
From 1081btc . to Everyone 08:28 PM
What is the incentive here for miners to create a block?
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 08:29 PM
what if one miner stakes 10 times as much as ETH than other miners? They could monopolize the pool.
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:29 PM
Who funds the block reward in the BTC blockchain
From gayatrisingalwar786@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:29 PM
even before getting in the network how will they invest in it?
From Pranav B to Everyone 08:29 PM
so there is no nonce in proof of stake?
From Hiten Bhatia to Everyone 08:30 PM
How many miners are there in the Ethereum network currently? And can anyone still become a miner with the investment?
From maverickmots@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:30 PM
is the 32eth miner joiner fee a deposit? or its not refundable
From Rudraraju Varma to Everyone 08:30 PM
so every miner will have 1 incentive?
From jinsongeo . to Everyone 08:30 PM
in PoW, will all the miners trying to create the next block have the same set of transactions?
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:31 PM
is there no geographical distance problem in creating a block transmission.Suppose someone sitting nearly great britain and one in india then there might be delay in transmission of block sitting at larger distance and the one sitting near.
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 08:31 PM
What if one miner stakes more ETH than other miners?
Does it not create a monopoly?
From ramanbhardwaj364@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:32 PM
will stake of let's say 32eth will be refunded to other non-selected miners?
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:32 PM
so rewards must be lower in eth blockchain compared to btc blockchain, given that there is less work involved
From gayatrisingalwar786@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:34 PM
so investment needs to be done to platform they are using for blockchain network?
and then they can start mining, is it like that?
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:36 PM
In POS, given that there is no central authority , who does the random selection of nodes for doing the next block creation
From mainak4ever@gmail.com . to Me (Direct Message) 08:36 PM
is proof of work, proof of stack and proof of stack authority different ?
From PRATIK SHIVAJI KALE . to Everyone 08:36 PM
is this a manual process or automatic process of miners and validation done by miners and creating the block ?
From mainak4ever@gmail.com . to Me (Direct Message) 08:39 PM
* proof of stake
ok
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:39 PM
whatis bitcoin bootstraped?
From jinsongeo . to Everyone 08:39 PM
what happens an assigned miner fails?
From gayatrisingalwar786@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:39 PM
sir i didn't get the thing of investing first and then mining
From Pranav B to Everyone 08:41 PM
can blockchain protocols can be changed later??
From mainak4ever@gmail.com . to Me (Direct Message) 08:42 PM
Binance uses Proof of stake authoriy , is it diffrent from proof of stake??
From ashok.shrinivas@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:53 PM
Not D
From Rudraraju Varma to Everyone 08:54 PM
in poet what hapens if 5 transactions exceeds 5 kb?
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:54 PM
what do you mean algo selects the bank from the eligible bank ... Where is this algo running and who is controlling it .. given that is decentralised network
From Satya to Everyone 08:56 PM
what happen bank b reject txn and bank c approve the txn then bank D will approve or reject ? 
From mohit_pu@yahoo.com . to Everyone 08:59 PM
POET is a part of Enterprise blockchain or Public Blockchain?
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:01 PM
ok
From Aravind M to Everyone 09:02 PM
Hi Jagadeesh,
Two concerns:
1. These protocols can be explained by Flowcharts  since it involves the execution of algorithms
2. Please try to upload the recordings at least 3 hours before the next class...so that we refer to this illustration before the next lecture starts.
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:03 PM
raft is same as poet or a different algorithm?

From 1081btc . to Everyone 09:11 PM
why is block 2 & block 3 changing ?
for peer a
We changed only block 1
Got it
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 09:12 PM
why doesnt it changes in peer 2 and 3?
From mohankumardmk1997 . to Everyone 09:12 PM
I think only forward blocks hash will be changed isnt it?
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 09:14 PM
got it
so how much time does it takes to send the money in blockchain transaction from joe to mark?
From shreyasbt . to Everyone 09:16 PM
As per this diagram, Mark receives the money only after the block gets added to the blockchain.. so in BTC, does it take about an hour for a transfer to happen??
From mrneeraj03 . to Everyone 09:17 PM
how much time it takes in all process
From dheerajmaske . to Everyone 09:17 PM
What is the duration between  broadcasting and the formation of block?
From Aravind M to Everyone 09:18 PM
This depiction is expected for algorithms like Pow, Pos, etc... as well...Hope you noted it down
The depiction of How transactions getting to Blockchain is SPOT-ON...Thanks
From sharma.kajal.19@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:19 PM
sir, can u plz let me knw, when we'll start the implementation 
 with coding??
From mohankumardmk1997 . to Everyone 09:19 PM
sir can you explain what happens if i send another transactions at the same time with same value to another address before one transaction gets processed?
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 09:19 PM
doesnt computation takes 1-2 hours?
From shreyasbt . to Everyone 09:19 PM
But the diagram showed the the transfer happens only after the block is added to the chain, which isn't the case as per the explanation just now
From Aravind M to Everyone 09:20 PM
Its about flow chart
Hi Jagadeesh,
Two concerns:
1. These protocols can be explained by Flowcharts  since it involves the execution of algorithms
2. Please try to upload the recordings at least 3 hours before the next class...so that we refer to this illustration before the next lecture starts.
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 09:21 PM
installing wallets etc .... will it be done in the Lab VM?
From PRATIK SHIVAJI KALE . to Everyone 09:21 PM
Flowchart for POW, POS and POET please 
From Satya to Everyone 09:21 PM
RBI Central Bank Digital Currency is which kind of protocal 
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 09:22 PM
doesnt computation takes 1-2 hours?
From Aravind M to Everyone 09:22 PM
Before the next class starts we have to make sure these algorithms got digested....that's why...I requested for earlier upload...Thanks
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:23 PM
can u provide easy example for POS POW AND POET
