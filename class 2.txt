Bocks are immutable right ?? so how no. of bitcoins in genesis block be updated??


From maverickmots@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:27 PM
how does the other nodes sync up? are there not conflicts between the nodes?
is there not race condition between the nodes?

Data Privacy: Private data fields ---> pan, ssn ----> privte data {89jkjhhih98098jj} ----> ledger

 public - ZKP
 private/permissioned -- private


Data Isolation:
 
 hash of the txn --> hash
 original txn - DB

compute hash of original txn ---> hash1 
 if hash1 = hash

Data Archival: large data and network may blowup

 1. data archival
 2. data snapshot

hash ---> one way  --> SHA 256, SHA 512, MD5, RIPEMD 160

symetric : user a and user b agree and share the same key --> not secure --> joint accounts

asymmetric : 

 for every user/transaction --- a keypair is generated (public key, private key)

 user a - pubkeyA, privkeyA

 user b - pubkeyB, privkeyB


applicationlevel:

 user a --> net banking
 nt banking ---> pubkey, privkey --->
 100 $ to user b 
txn (usera, 100, userb) ---> using pub key of user b


 user b (pub, priv) --> decoded with priv key of user b
  ---> 100

Instead of using recepient pub key to encrypt if we use SENDER private ky to encrypt we call it as digital signature


sender usera (65, 94)  (102, 57)

recepient userb (41, 118) (109, 50)


1 sender to multiple recepinets

 sender sign with his private key, so that others can decrypt with senders public key

to maintain integrity and secure of message : use both encryption + Hashing

 (user a ---> hello ----> user b)

1. encrypt the message with user a private key ---> 87987njkjhijhij
2. calc the hash of input message              ---> d26edd33c0bc435c4bd6abf638d05e38345e609a96a661a464069726ff314f80 

3. the transaction has now (input message + encryption , hash value)

recepient will decrypt the original message 
  87987njkjhijhij ---> user a pubic key ---> hello 
  comput the hash of input ---> d26edd33c0bc435c4bd6abf638d05e38345e609a96a661a464069726ff314f80 
  transaction also includes hash  ---> if hash calculated == hash received in the transaction

 1. fill block size of 2 kb
 2. fill 10 transactions 

8 txns ---> 2kb


9 txns ----> 1kb
10 txn ----> 1.2 kb


Snapshotting:

 1. either the network participants/entities
 2. individual entities

Intermittent transactions:
--------------------------

 1. Public     ----> transaction pool servers ( 100/200 nodes )
 2. Private    ----> intermitent servers/databses (admin/network operator)
 3. Enterprise ----> stored in distributed databases (cassandra/couch db/rocks db etc)



100 servers:
-------------

 level    1. validates these 5 transactions --- easy step [ 1 2 3 4 5]
 level    2. computes hash of these transactions (is easy to compute hash from input) -- 909798jbjkbhbhbhb9809809 --> easy step [ 1 2 3 4 5 ]
 level    3. puzzle is to apend/prefix 10 zeros to the hash value computed in step2   -- 0000000000+909798jbjkbhbhbhb9809809 
 level    4. send to other miners for validation

yes sir 
From shreyasbt . to Everyone 07:52 PM
Where would the snapshot hash be stored.. would it again be on the same blockchain?
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 07:52 PM
sir what is the use of archiving the data in a hash, because either way they wont be able decrypt it?
From jinsongeo . to Everyone 07:53 PM
after data snapshot, what happens to the 1st 100 blocks in our example?
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 07:55 PM
ok sir
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 07:56 PM
so in a way you are archiving the old blocks in traditional DB and doing a fresh start to the block chain
From Pranav B to Everyone 07:56 PM
snapshot will be created in the existing blockchain?
From zuluoscar65 . to Everyone 07:57 PM
just like forking sir
From varmarudraraju3 . to Everyone 07:57 PM
what happens to the genissi block in this case?
From jinsongeo . to Everyone 07:57 PM
will those 100 blocks go to the offchain DB?
From varmarudraraju3 . to Everyone 07:57 PM
after archivl of data?
From ashok.shrinivas@gmail.com . to Everyone 07:59 PM
can the Genesis block be changed  if no new blocks are created?
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 07:59 PM
so are the 1st 100 blocks REMOVED after their hash archived?
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 08:00 PM
sir can you please  slow down a bit, its getting too technical and difficult to understand.
From varmarudraraju3 . to Everyone 08:00 PM
say supppose i have 200 blocks and i want to create a snapshot of 100 blocks. how it is going to effect 101 block
From dheeraj.kakara@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:00 PM

What is the logic for using Receipient's public key to encrypt?
I can use User a's Public key to encrypt and reciepient's pvt key to decrypt
?
From ashok.shrinivas@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:43 PM
when a bank want to receive a file form another company securely ... they will ask the company to encrypt using their pubkey(which is already sent to them in advance)
From varmarudraraju3 . to Everyone 08:45 PM
show the example once again browser
From Pragati  to Everyone 08:46 PM
what is verify signature here used for?
ok..
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:48 PM
If one sender has to send the message to many receivers. will the sender encrypt using its private key or encrypt many times using the receivers public key (one time each for the each reciever)
From 1081btc . to Everyone 08:50 PM
Both ends will recieve same set of pair?
From Pragati  to Everyone 08:50 PM
can you explain it again
like with another example

From zuluoscar65 . to Everyone 09:02 PM
can hashes be decrypted? same question
From ashok.shrinivas@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:03 PM
No - its oneway
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 09:03 PM
is it using a time parameter?
From zuluoscar65 . to Everyone 09:03 PM
ok (Y)
From gayatrisingalwar786@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:04 PM
yes
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 09:04 PM
so does hash out changes if we change algo?
output*
From gayatrisingalwar786@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:04 PM
if we are encrypting it with hash then how will we decrypt it?
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:05 PM
ok 
ook 
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 09:05 PM
what is the minimum size of a hash of lets say 1gb data?
From gayatrisingalwar786@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:07 PM
screen stuck for me
From ashok.shrinivas@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:07 PM
depends on the algorithm used. 1gb or 1kb  one algorithm will generate hash of the same size
From Aravind Kumar M to Everyone 09:08 PM
do we need to do the hashing for encrypted message or original message
From PRATIK SHIVAJI KALE . to Everyone 09:08 PM
what is use of hashing here?
From Aravind Kumar M to Everyone 09:09 PM
for data integrity hashing to complement encryption
From shreyasbt . to Everyone 09:09 PM
what if the hash is also manipulated to match the hacked encrypted msg?
From PRATIK SHIVAJI KALE . to Everyone 09:10 PM
ok 
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:10 PM
if hacker is able to change the (encrypted) message .. I believe hacker could even recalculate the new hash for the new message and send to receiver
From gayatrisingalwar786@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:10 PM
and how the hash from the sender is sent to recepient, to check if the hash matches with the sender
From Aravind Kumar M to Everyone 09:11 PM
do you think the miners are there to find the hashing...to verify the transaction
From gayatrisingalwar786@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:11 PM
okay
From Aravind Kumar M to Everyone 09:11 PM
that's why miners need high power of computation
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 09:11 PM
do we need to do the hashing for encrypted message or original message

From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 09:14 PM
slide 25: what if transaction S does not yet exist?
From gayatrisingalwar786@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:15 PM
can u explain it again
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 09:15 PM
can you explain merkle root?
From Pragati  to Everyone 09:16 PM
so, basically merkle root is created at last! and how and where it used!?
From sharma.kajal.19@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:18 PM
and when the transactions are in odd in number??
then what happend to the merkel tree?
From gayatrisingalwar786@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:18 PM
so if we have more data the hashing is done by dividing data then combined ?
From 1081btc . to Everyone 09:21 PM
So header has both Merkel root hash + previous block hash?
From Pragati  to Everyone 09:22 PM
how much information/transactions can be stored in a block!?
From zuluoscar65 . to Everyone 09:22 PM
ok sir
From 1081btc . to Everyone 09:23 PM
& merkel root has becomes hash in next block?
From gayatrisingalwar786@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:23 PM
if the genesis block has merkle tree hash so all the following has should have merkle root hash?
From ashok.shrinivas@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:24 PM
 each block creates its own merkeltree hash
From varmarudraraju3 . to Everyone 09:24 PM
so transactional data is distributed across different blocks?
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 09:25 PM
so merkle root hash is created after all the data input in a block?
can we set that only 10 txn are part of every block before hand?
From Aravind Kumar M to Everyone 09:25 PM
How we can overcome the storage limit of the node participating in network...because the participating node has to adopt all transactions
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 09:25 PM
does the merkle root of block 1 get added to merkle root of 2 also and so on and so forth?
From jinsongeo . to Everyone 09:26 PM
What happens in the case of Data Snapshot and the first 100 blocks are archived
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:27 PM
Merkel tree is too hard can't able  understand clearly 
From mohit_pu@yahoo.com . to Everyone 09:27 PM
The hash value doesnt help you with the encryption or decrypt the data as in we can't derive the data from hash value. but if we have the original data we can compare the hash value to verify . is it ?
From Aravind Kumar M to Everyone 09:28 PM
thanks....so snapshoting strategy varies from node and node depending upon its storage limi
From varmarudraraju3 . to Everyone 09:28 PM
snapshot hash will  then be the previous hash?
From sharma.kajal.19@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:28 PM
so block size are vary or it will be fixed?for making chain we have to fix the size of block...as every block have to keep the transaction record below the 2kb or 3kb?
From Aravind Kumar M to Everyone 09:29 PM
who will take care of snapshoting strategy
From maverickmots@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:31 PM
until the block is created, where are the transactions floating around? in databases?
From jinsongeo . to Everyone 09:32 PM
so blocks after data snapshot will only have transactions after the snapshot?
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:32 PM
you mean outside of the blockchain node
From maverickmots@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:32 PM
thank you
yes
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:32 PM
OK
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:32 PM
30 min can we extend 
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 09:32 PM
on block size, what decides the completion of the block? (time, size, or number of transactions)?
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:33 PM
plz sir 
sir 
hello 
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:33 PM
in transit storage of transactions in redis / cassandra , I assume that is outside of blockchain node
From ashok.shrinivas@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:33 PM
there is no Auto mute today
From skyaseenmuskan03370 . to Everyone 09:34 PM
Hello guys
From ashok.shrinivas@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:34 PM
we are able to unmute
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:34 PM
plz can u extend the till 30 min 
ok 
From vivekjamshedpur . to Everyone 09:34 PM
thanks
From Aravind Kumar M to Everyone 09:35 PM
It will be great if you share the layered architecture of different participants like the cache to hold transactions not been part of block...there is no solid grip I am getting on that from Arch and tech stack involved
From maverickmots@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:35 PM
hi guys, theres an unofficial whatsapp group created by dheeraj if you wanna join.. helpful to share doubts/ links or any info related to the class
https://chat.whatsapp.com/E3eWCooBrVzBoIkEFM2BHv
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:38 PM
SIR,UNTIL THE BLOCKS ARE CREATED U SAY THAT DATA IS STORED IN DISTRIBUTED DATABASES LIKE REDIS/CASSANDRA .DOES NT IT MEAN THAT TILL THE BLOCK IS CREATED WE ARE RELYING ON CENTRALIZED DATABASE.
From parveen.sahrawat1209@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:00 PM
yes
From Kaleemulla Mohammed . to Everyone 10:00 PM
Yes
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:00 PM

YES
From r.motwani@tcs.com . to Everyone 10:00 PM
yes
From ramanbhardwaj364@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:00 PM
back!
From skmr5613 . to Everyone 10:01 PM
Yes
From Aravind Kumar M to Everyone 10:06 PM
preferably NOSQL...why its so? 
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:11 PM
what is this link about 
sir 
From Aravind Kumar M to Everyone 10:13 PM
Got it you prefer NOSQL to achieve distributed Database...its not based upon the growing number of transactions
From sharma.kajal.19@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:17 PM
can u plz repeate it??
From Me to Everyone 10:19 PM
https://app.diagrams.net/
From Pranav B to Everyone 10:19 PM
trnsaction pool also have consensus?
From Aravind Kumar M to Everyone 10:19 PM
thanks a lot...it brings some clarity...Do you think consensus major role in snapshoting as well?
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:19 PM
NICE EXPLAINATION SIR DOUBT CLEAR 
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:20 PM
because there is no central authority ensuring trust
From prakashvedv . to Everyone 10:20 PM
All parties should agree to a protocol of honouring the transaction, and it's integrity
From Aravind Kumar M to Everyone 10:21 PM
thanks a lot...it brings some clarity...Do you think consensus *Plays major role in snapshoting as well?
From gayatrisingalwar786@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:21 PM
we need to maintain integrity and security of the data
so consensus protocol does thay
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:24 PM
where is consensus algo executed 
From Mohit Verma to Everyone 10:26 PM
yes
From ashok.shrinivas@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:26 PM
yes
From Satya to Everyone 10:26 PM
yes
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:26 PM
there would be many miners .. so who owns this 
From vivekjamshedpur . to Everyone 10:27 PM
voice is breaking
now it is ok
From ashok.shrinivas@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:39 PM
4,0 or 3,0 after gen 3 is booted out?
From parveen.sahrawat1209@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:41 PM
Sir what if the removed node wants to come back later?
Thanks sir.
From ashok.shrinivas@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:41 PM
thx
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 10:54 PM
Do a miners creates the blockchain or some private entity or the organization to whom the data belong?
sir can you please explain that again?
yes sir
pow not understood
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 10:59 PM
yes
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:59 PM
yes
From Mohit Verma to Everyone 10:59 PM
\yes
From prakashvedv . to Everyone 10:59 PM
yes
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:59 PM
YES
From Mainak Mitra to Everyone 11:02 PM
then the main requirement of puzzle is to give the miners upper hand of creating block with their preferred transactions and get the mining fee ??
From prakashvedv . to Everyone 11:02 PM
can it be any puzzle, or something specific
From Mohit Verma to Everyone 11:03 PM
yes
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 11:04 PM
where do we add them to get those zeros?
From Mohit Verma to Everyone 11:07 PM
Bitcoin hashrate has been as high as 179 exahashes per second (1 exahash = 1 quintillion)
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 11:07 PM
so if the bank has the data, and the miners creates the block from them and they get paid by the bank?
From ramanbhardwaj364@gmail.com . to Everyone 11:07 PM
clear now!
From Aravind Kumar M to Everyone 11:07 PM
Only in the public blockchain, are the miners involved to validate the transactions right?
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 11:08 PM
clear about pow
From prakashvedv . to Everyone 11:08 PM
won't the zero prefix change the hash value?
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 11:09 PM
CAN THE PUZZLE BE SOLVED EASILY IF QUANTUM COMPUTERS COME I FUTURE
OK SIR
From jinsongeo . to Everyone 11:10 PM
is the puzzle fixed and does only the number of zeros to be appended change?
From Mohit Verma to Everyone 11:10 PM
with the quantum computers the competition will take a quantum leap as well in terms of difficulty. 
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 11:10 PM
Given the approach of consensus formulation .. can it happen that some transactions could get disadvantaged and may get committed late or not at all .. How is that avoided
From Aravind M to Everyone 11:15 PM
where this difficulty factor will be available for miners
you mean to say in the header of block
great
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 11:16 PM
sir what do you mean by difficulty level?
and also nonce?
From Aravind M to Everyone 11:17 PM
So difficulty level and nonce varies from block to block in the network its been involved
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 11:17 PM
For public blockchain - Who is validating the hash calculated by the miners and who was fastest in calculating?
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 11:19 PM
sir what do you mean by difficulty level?

From jinsongeo . to Everyone 11:19 PM
will the other miners stop solving the PoW puzzle when a miner send the value for validation?
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 11:19 PM
ok
Given the approach of consensus formulation .. can it happen that some transactions could get disadvantaged and may get committed late or not at all .. How is that avoided
From jinsongeo . to Everyone 11:27 PM
wont the order of transactions differ if miners go behind transactions of higher value
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 11:27 PM
WHATAPP SAYS THAT THE MESSAGES WE SEND ON WHATSAPP ARE END-TO-END ENCRYPTED NOONE EVEN WHATSAPP CAN TRACE THE MESSAGE B/W TWO PARTIES BUT WHEN WE INSTALL WHATSAPP THEN AT TIME OF INSTALLING IT WILL ASK TO PROVIDE PERMISSIONS TO META TO ACCES DEVICE LOCATION AND MEDIA.SO WHEN WE DO ANY MESSAGE COMMUNICATION IN WHATS APP THEY GET STORED IN OUR DEVICE FROM WHERE META CAN SEE WHAT KINDS OF MEDIA WE ARE SHARING AS WE HAVE GIVEN ACCESS RIGHTS TO OUR DEVICE TO THEM.THOUGH THEY ARE NIOT MAKING FOOL TO PEOPLE IN THE NAME OF END-TO-END ENCRYPTION.
From Aravind M to Everyone 11:29 PM
pow is automatic in enterprise blockchains it will be taken care of by consensus??

If that's the case why we cannot achieve the same by consensus?  Is that because the public blockchains don't have option to store floating blocks?
Ok  got it
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 11:30 PM
Thank you the lecture sir. 
From ajaypalam87 . to Everyone 11:30 PM
hello sir 
From Pranav B to Everyone 11:31 PM
Who or what defines difficulty level?
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 11:31 PM
thank you sir, see you next week.
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 11:32 PM
who decides for bitcoin as it doesnt have any single founder ?
From ajaypalam87 . to Everyone 11:32 PM
i was new today ,don't understand much ,so kindly support. even i haven't found  my learning track .
yes.
From Pranav B to Everyone 11:32 PM
but difficulty level varies for every transactions right?
From ajaypalam87 . to Everyone 11:33 PM
 not findig the recordings
but yesterday was also not found
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 11:33 PM
hello, I can see the recording for yesterday's class on the portal. I can also play it. But how do I download it to watch it off line?

THAKS FOR SHARING VALUABLE INFORMATION GD NIGHT FRIENDS
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 11:34 PM
who decides difficulty level for bitcoin as it doesn't have any single company or organisation?
