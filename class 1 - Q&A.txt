how will the Genesis have miner data?
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 09:26 PM
so does hash block also have transactions?
or not
From PRATIK SHIVAJI KALE . to Everyone 09:26 PM
Genesis block has hash (his own), it will not have hash of previous block 
From dheerajmaske . to Everyone 09:27 PM
Every network will have it's own Genesis block?
From yashdoshi51 . to Me (Direct Message) 09:27 PM

Bocks are immutable right ?? so how no. of bitcoins in genesis block be updated??
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:30 PM
is there any other cryptographic concept other than hash?
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 09:31 PM

From Mainak Mitra to Everyone 09:31 PM
ok
From maverickmots@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:31 PM
but how do you add the nodes to the genesis block?
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 09:31 PM
why cant genesis block have any data?
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:31 PM
genesis block has data but not previous hash
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:31 PM
ok sir

From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 09:33 PM
pace is ok. please explain in layman terms and with more example 
From zuluoscar65 . to Everyone 09:33 PM
like we could maintain supply by burning coins? is it poosible?
From dheerajmaske . to Everyone 09:34 PM
What if we have a consensus to modify the blockchain in private blockchain?
From vivekjamshedpur . to Everyone 09:35 PM
how the block. who tell that 1mn block reached
From 1081btc . to Everyone 09:35 PM
Hash only acts to link the blocks but not as an encryption of data on previous block?
ok
From zuluoscar65 . to Everyone 09:35 PM
ok sir.
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 09:35 PM
yes
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:35 PM

end date:

 to smart contracts that creates unique id for me on blockchain for tohers to validate and verify my creditials

tokenizee --- token id (209898098)

query data from blockchain by passing this uniq (209898098), created by university ABC

Fungible tokens vs non fungible tokens:

 Fungible tokens --> each and evry token is same --- digitial currency (bitcoin,ethereum)
 Non fungible token --> each and evry token is diff


Banka, b ,c ,d ,e , bank e (regulator bank) --- USE case

bank a lend 100 CR to bank b (bank a, b) (bank a, b, c, d, e)

bank e wish to verify the amt of bank a lent to other banks ---> it can perform an analytical query on data avaailble in the ledger

public blockchains --> data visiblity of other banks is an issue

privtae blockahins/enterprise blockchains ---> data hiding/private data collection

 based on txn origination , banks can specify the data visilibyt parameters 

 bank a --- bank b , ---- bank e (bank1, transfer amt 100 CR, bank b, approved by bank e)

 c,d----> stores the hash of the data hash(bank1, transfer amt 100 CR, bank b, approved by bank e)

  { 
     record/store the transaction
  }


data is stored on blockchains:

1. data can be persisted (backup) on external disk/hardware
2. sync data in the network from others

   seed nodes in the network (this will help in sync up to date ledger)

From Mainak Mitra to Everyone 09:31 PM
ok
From maverickmots@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:31 PM
but how do you add the nodes to the genesis block?
From yashdoshi51 . to Everyone 09:31 PM
why cant genesis block have any data?

From vivekjamshedpur . to Everyone 09:35 PM
how the block. who tell that 1mn block reached
From 1081btc . to Everyone 09:35 PM

From jinsongeo . to Everyone 10:26 PM
what happens when the nodes come back online, will these nodes be prevented from participating in the consensus until they are synce?
From maverickmots@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:27 PM
how does the other nodes sync up? are there not conflicts between the nodes?
is there not race condition between the nodes?
From varmarudraraju3 . to Everyone 10:27 PM
how banka and bank data is kept in sync?
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:32 PM
Even though its highly distributed across multiple parties in the network .. Would one party's applications read data from other party's nodes ..?  Doubtful
From tanwarkaku09@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:33 PM
what is the meaning of anonymity 
sir 
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:37 PM
in this example bank e has a special role and need for seeing this data. but bank c and d having access to bank a <-> bank b transactions , would that not cause data privacy issues
From ankitdhr19@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:37 PM
every node in blockchain an read data of other nodes does it not mean thatv it is breach of viewing others data which is not required at particular node.
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:42 PM
got it. thanks
perfect
From Pranav B to Everyone 10:42 PM
In private enterprise blockchains are serves managed by themselves only or they have their own network only and servers are distributed randomly??
From maverickmots@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:45 PM
if two transactions are triggered by bank a->b, are there a chance they get validated beyond the limits if they get validated by two different nodes at simultaneous times? Can transactions be corrected in this case?
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 10:45 PM
so is there a employee of one company that has preference to maintain?
From dheerajmaske . to Everyone 10:46 PM
Longest chain is considered
From maverickmots@gmail.com . to Everyone 10:48 PM
okay, can they get executed on two different nodes on the same bank? if some nodes are offline and some nodes are online?
just to follow up on the prev question
so can they go beyond the limits? as in bank A has 100 cr in total but the transaction gets executed twice for 200 cr
From Hiten Bhatia to Everyone 10:51 PM
Do seed nodes work as normal nodes also?
Or are they just for snycing?
From jinsongeo . to Everyone 10:51 PM

From dheerajmaske . to Everyone 11:06 PM
In peer to peer distributed network, does every node acts as a server? 
If every node acts as a server, does the duplicate copies are created for every node or it retrieves from somewhere?
Somewhere*=centralized server
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 11:06 PM
This must incur high admin costs, the moment a new node or party is added , that many interconnections would need to be maintained
From 1081btc . to Everyone 11:08 PM
Bur A regulator and rules of visibility will beat the very purpose of enterprise blockchain ?
From vivekjamshedpur . to Everyone 11:08 PM

From Hiten Bhatia to Everyone 11:09 PM

From 1081btc . to Everyone 11:10 PM
I think Indian CBDC - which is recently rolled out is not on blockchain...its just a digital asset. NOt sure
