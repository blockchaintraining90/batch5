Step 1 --> Download the app image from URL https://download.electrum.org/4.1.2/    (electrum-4.1.2-x86_64.AppImage)

Step 2 --> Goto download folder and then right click and choose "open terminal"

Step 3 --> sudo chmod +x electrum-4.1.2-x86_64.AppImage and enter

Step 4 --> run the script sudo ./electrum-4.1.2-x86_64.AppImage --testnet

5. It will open the instalation wizard

6. Follow steps as per DOC

7. goto url https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/ for test BTC




smart contract logic:
-----------------------


 a = a + b --->

 a+= b    --->


 a = a + b  ----> 3 bytes ---> 1 byte ---> 7000 gas ----> 21000 gas ---> 100 eth
 
 a+= b ----> 2 bytes --------> 1 byte ---> 7000 gas ----> 14000 gas  ---> 75 eth


wait basket walnut promote cradle once consider gorilla matrix shoot notable web


Bitcoin vs Ethereum:
---------------------

Mining ---> POW (hash puzzle/nonce value/txn validation)
       ---> POS (txn validatins)


Use commands to grant privlges to the app image file

3. use command to lauch the wallet
4. create seed phrase
5. copy the seed pharse
5. reenter the seed phrase
6. RECEIVE tab
7. click on new address tab
8. goto test faucet url https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/
9. paste ur adress and enter


Enhanced security:
-------------------

1. opt for bulk wallet (which generates multiple public/private keys). So that every transaction can be encrypted using different keys everytime.


we have concept of network id/chain id parameters

1. '1' --- eth mainnet
2. '5777' -- eth testnet



images ----> Metadata ---> offchain (IPFS --- ETH) ---> unique

{
   pixel details --->
 heght 100 px
 breadth

}

image (underlying metadata) ----> hash (image) ---> unique id for every image ---> as input to the block

NFT - Non Fungible tokens

chareteristics:
---------------

1. each and every token is unique
2. can track the ownership details by querying the current ownership
3. maintains history of the NFT over a period

we can create an NFT for lets say a Banking BOND 

NFT ---> 12345 (ERC721) -- these standards help in maintaing aset life cycle with prebuilt functions

func currentOwner (nft id) ownerAddress()
func previousHist (nft id) [] ownerAddress()
 
bank A ---> bank B

bank B ---> bank C


{
 name : Bank bond
 issuer: bank A
 debter: ban B
 issuance : jan 15th 2023
 expire date : feb 15th 2023
 amout value : 50 CR INR/USD
}

have smart contract features that automatically initiate a transfer transaction from bank B to bank A


type block 

{
  block id
  txn  datatype
  data  dattype
}


creation of blocks:
----------------------

1. no of txn OR  ---> 125 txn
2. size of block OR ---> 1MB
3. block cutting timer ---> 30 sec


100 txn ---> 900kb ----(last 15 mins) --- we were not bale to create block for 15mins --> not efficient

30 sec: more efficient



Bitcoin follows UTXO data validation model

UTXO --- unspent transaction output --> helps in preventing double spending problem

we have to avoid double spending is we are grouping multiple txn in a block for a finite period

this can result in same txn proposed more than once in the network

same 5 BTC transfer from user a to user b ----> 1 txn more than once

User A: 
-------

network visibility:
--------------------

1. purchases 10 BTC from exchange ----> txn1 ---> (10 BTC as input, 0 BTC as output) -- Unspent 1

2. user A has received 3 BTC from user B ---> 



end user visibility:
--------------------
3. user queries the balance ---> it identifies how many unspent txn are in the wallet and aggregates
                            ---> txn1 , txn2 ---> 10,3 --> 13 BTC

4. user A wishes to transfer 2 BTC to user C
    txn3 ---> it spends the UTXO txn2 and creates new entry ---> 
              txn2 ---> (3 BTC) -- this is consumed/utilized --- spent 2
              txn3 ---> (2 BTC, 1 BTC) --- Unspent 3


5. user queries the balance
    txn1 -- unspent --- 10 btc
    txn2 -- spent   
    txn3 -- unspent --   1 btc
   10+1 == 11 btc

how does UTXO helps in mitigating double spending

it's done with 5-10 sec

block 1 [ {txn1 --- user A} {txn2 --- user B} { txn3 --- user C} {txn1 --- user A} ]

 with this UTXO ---> 1 txn is valid, reject the 2nd txn


txn1 ---> 2 btc -- spent

txn2 ---> 1 btc -- spent
          
          (input, output)
txn3 ---> (3 BTC, 3 BTC) ---> spent 
 txn4(2) --> 0 BTC

after block created.... eventually miners will check the balance of the sender account

creates a new state out of it 3 btc ---> user b

as long as these unspent txn are spent entirely resulting in the same input

user transfers 3 btc to user X --->



0.5 btc ---> 0.000015 txn
0.1 btc ---> 0.0000001 txn



Transaction input:
------------------

1. Transfer of 5 BTC from user a to user b
2. user a pub key ---> 12345 , priv key ---> 678912345
2. digitally sign the transaction with user a private key (user a, 5 btc, user b) + encyypted with privkey
   ====> ihuil87608790jkj98098[098[909890lkjlkj

3. this is captured as scriptsig in the BTC ---> hash (digital signtaure) and public key


Transaction output:
-------------------

1. DUP
2. HASH160
3. original pub Key hash
4. equal verify
5. check signature


step1 ---> push digitl sign into the stack --->   ihuil87608790jkj98098[098[909890lkjlkj
(transaction input) step2 ---> pub key 12345 
step3 ---> copy the public key into the stack and compute hash of it ---> ghtdhyuoo
(txn output)step4 ---> it has public key hash captured ---> hash(12345) ---> ghtdhyuoo
step5 ---> compare f public key is same as public key fro input (step 2 and step4)


1. we can derive public key from private key and digital signature (cryptograhy)

assume that bitcoin is runnig across 2000 nodes globally

2000 ----> 600 miner nodes ----> [ country 1 (100) , country 2 (50) , country3 (150) ] ===> ~ 50% ---> 300 miners
 50% ---> miners are coordinting amongh themselves

This image data is that of image / item catalog .. these are not financial transactions . So is non transactional data also stored within blocks
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:32 PM

From jinsongeo . to Everyone 08:42 PM

 no. of chain = (no. miners + no. miner pools)
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 08:43 PM
referring to that example where image pixels were also stored on blockchain . Is it not efficient to just keep financial transactions data .. buy/sell/ownership in blockchain and keep other asset data like image pixels in traditional databases ... otherwise 1 MB block size will get exhaust very soon with less transactions
From mrneeraj03 . to Everyone 08:44 PM
how much longer can be a chain ?
ok sir
From jinsongeo . to Everyone 08:44 PM

if txn x unspent has 2 btc and txn y unspent has 1 btc, if i want to transfer 3 btc to C , then how will it work ?
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 09:13 PM
what if the 2nd transaction is also authentic ... meaning transaction 1 is a transfer from A to B  of 1 BTC ..... and the 3 minutes later transaction 2 is also a transfer from A to B .... of another 3 BTC
From maverickmots@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:14 PM
this would only be happening is user A is receiving at the same time A is spending. if A received it and the intiates, it would be 2 different transactions right ? rec and transfer ie.
From saeed_raghib@msn.com . to Everyone 09:20 PM

sir every time/transaction fees is included?
ok sir
From ramanbhardwaj364@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:29 PM

or both have to pay?
From zuluoscar65 . to Everyone 09:29 PM
yes sir break. time
From girish.khemani76@gmail.com . to Everyone 09:29 PM
given that there is significant delay in transactions getting confirmed .. this would also be significant drawbacks for variety of financial transactions which need instantaneous transfer
From 1081btc . to Everyone 09:30 PM
it depends on exchanges too ? fees
But over the period of time fees will come down ?
From zuluoscar65 . to Everyone 09:31 PM

QUESTION: 
	Sir, I am not able to create a support ticket in Arya. This is happening because when I log in, this (IIT BC Cert Course) course is not listed in the ARYA's help dialog box of the simplilearn portal. 
	Other courses that I have from the "Simplilearn Cert-School" are listed, but this course (IIT Blockchain Certification) from the "Simplilearn LMS" is not listed. So I am not able to select the course to create a support ticket against it.
	This course was visible before (two weeks ago). Now it has disappeared.
	
	How do I connect with Simplilearn and support???
